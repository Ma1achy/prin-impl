//! `cargo xtask deps` — checks the workspace crate graph against the allowed-edge table of
//! systems_architecture §7.1, the crate map (R-170, confirmed by R-185). REQ-SYS-004.
//!
//! Edges *inside* one crate (decoder before kernel, canonicalise before the integrator) are not visible to
//! a crate-graph check; they stay a code-review item (systems_architecture §7.1).
//!
//! It also enforces R-187's condition on the `validation` dev-dependency: in `kernel` and `ledger`, no
//! source under `src/` uses `validation` (a test that does is an integration test in `tests/`), because
//! the dev-dependency cycle would give unit tests two copies of the crate (`Metadata::source_violations`). The scan
//! fails on any identifier named `validation` there, a local item included (a deliberate over-approximation: it
//! has no name resolution), and requires the crates' library and binary targets in `src/`. So that the scan of the
//! `.rs` files under `src/` is the whole of what those crates compile there, `#[path]` and `include!` are forbidden
//! in their `src/` (R-189, which replaces R-188's following of `include!`).

///   counts as a use of the crate, a local item with the same name included (`mod validation`, `fn validation`, an
///   associated item `<T as Tr>::validation`). This over-approximates R-187 on purpose: from edition 2018
///   `validation::x` may name a local module or the extern crate, and only name resolution can tell them apart,
///   so a check without it that must never pass a real use has to fail both. Rename the local item.
/// - `Forbidden::PathAttribute` (R-189): an identifier `path` followed by `=` anywhere inside an attribute, so
///   `#[path = …]`, `#![path = …]` and `#[cfg_attr(…, path = …)]`, in a `macro_rules!` body too. Another attribute
///   with a `path = …` argument fails as well (an over-approximation, never under).
/// - `Forbidden::Include` (R-189): an identifier `include` followed by `!`, so `include!`, `std::include!` and
///   `core::include!`, whatever their argument, in a `macro_rules!` body too. `include_str!` and `include_bytes!`
///   are other identifiers and stay allowed: they expand to a `&str` or `&[u8]` value, never to Rust tokens.
